1. To start the game run index.html in your browser.
2. Use arrow keys to move avatar on the map.
3. Avoid bugs as they are the enemies and colliding with one will subtract from your score.
4. To score you need to navigate the avatar to the water without being hit by the enemy.
5. Once you hit the water or enemy the avatar will restart to the original start position and the score will be updated.
